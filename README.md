# ðŸŽ¸ Music Player

A simple and interactive music player built as part of the [FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-string-and-array-methods-by-building-a-music-player/).  
This project focuses on practicing **basic string and array methods** in JavaScript while building a functional UI.
