# 🎸 Music Player

A simple and interactive music player built as part of the [FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-string-and-array-methods-by-building-a-music-player/).  
This project focuses on practicing **basic string and array methods** in JavaScript while building a functional UI.

## 📜 Project Overview

The Music Player allows users to:
- Navigate through a playlist
- Play and pause songs
- View song details like title and artist
- Understand the use of JavaScript array and string manipulation methods in a real-world example
